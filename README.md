<h1>#EDUCATION-PORTAL</h1>
<h3> Details of the Portal :</h3>    
  <ul>
	<li>The 'Brain Opener's E Learning Portal' has a dual level structure -  Teacher level and Student level</li>

<li>   Only authorised teachers can log in, create the study material and create or modify the question bank for quiz . (Data-security) </li>

<li>   Similarly, a student can also create an account,
      view the study material and take a quiz on whichever 
      chapters he desires.  </li>

  <li> A special feature of the quiz is that the teacher
      can mark the difficulty level of a question as 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Difficult' so that all the students get
      the same level of questions, though the questions being randomly selected. </li>
