* A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
* In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link
* Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes.
* Nodes can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware.
* It allows users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, online chat
* Most information in computer networks is carried in packets. 
* A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.
* Packets are sent through the network to their destination. 
* Once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original message.
* A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media.
* A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. 
* A network bridge connects and filters traffic between two network segments. 
* A switch is distinct from a hub.
* It only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected.
* A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by using a routing table.
* For housing servers, 80-20  rule is used
* For the use of repeaters 5-4-3 rule is used. 

* The first worldwide network which led to the formation of Internet was ARPANET.
